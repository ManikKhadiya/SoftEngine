# main.js Documentation

This file contains the main logic for rendering 3D graphics using a custom engine built on top of Babylon.js. The key components include initialization, mesh creation, and the animation loop.

## Overview

The main responsibilities of `main.js` include:

- Initializing the canvas and rendering context.
- Setting up a camera for viewing the scene.
- Defining the 3D mesh (in this case, a cube).
- Implementing the animation loop to continuously render frames.

## Code Breakdown

### Initialization

```javascript
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", init, false);
