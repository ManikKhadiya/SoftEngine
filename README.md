# 3D Soft Engine using HTML5 Canvas

This is a simple and quick attempt of making a 3D Soft Engine
I followed this tutorial (https://www.sitepoint.com/write-3d-soft-engine-scratch-part-1/) sent by Megan McLeod

This project demonstrates a simple 3D soft engine using HTML5 Canvas and Babylon.js.

## Prerequisites

- Make sure you have either Firefox or Chrome installed.

## How to Run

### Option 1: Using Live Server in VS Code
1. Install the **Live Server** extension in Visual Studio Code.
2. Right-click on the `index.html` file and select **Open with Live Server**.
3. The project will automatically open in your default browser.

### Option 2: Manually Opening in a Browser
1. Open the `index.html` file located in the `source` directory.
2. Double-click to open it in your preferred browser (Firefox or Chrome).

### Option 3: Using Scripts
If you're on Linux/Mac:
1. Run the `start.sh` script in the terminal:
   ```bash
   ./start.sh

# 3D Soft Engine

This project implements a simple 3D graphics engine using HTML5 Canvas and Babylon.js. The engine is designed to render a rotating cube and serves as a foundational framework for building more complex 3D scenes.

## Features

- **3D Rendering:** Renders a rotating cube using vertices and faces defined in JavaScript.
- **Camera Control:** Simple camera implementation allowing dynamic viewing of the 3D scene.
- **Modular Design:** Engine classes are modular, enabling easy expansion and integration of new features.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3D-Soft-Engine.git
